### SeparateTwoSpiralsUsingNeuralNetwork.ipynb can be used demo the use of Fully-connected layers model.

### First_CNN_model_for_MNIST.ipynb can be used as our first CNN model with 2 convolutional layers and 2 FC layers. This for the MNIST dataset

### First_CNN_model_for_STL.ipynb can be used as our first CNN model with 2 convolutional layers and 2 FC layers. This for the STL dataset
